### Hi there 👋

- I'm currently a blockchain developer with experience in EVM and Solana. I focus on frontend and anything web3 related except smart contracts (although I want to learn)
- I'm a cofounder of [pinwin.xyz](https://pinwin.xyz), a sports-betting interface built on Solana and other EVM chains
- I'm lead engineer of [Speed Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexthelion123.boltexponativewind), a full-stack Solana mobile wallet using React Native and AWS
- 🔭 I’ve previously made extensive contributions to the Python codebase for [Trading Strategy](https://tradingstrategy.ai/)
- I've also worked as a Dune analyst before. See my Dune profile [here](https://dune.com/alexth)
- 🌱 I’m currently also studying react front-end, smart contracts, graphql and all things web3 related
